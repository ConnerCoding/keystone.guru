## About keystone.guru

Keystone.guru is a website where users can build and find their favorite routes for completing in Mythic Plus in World of Warcraft®: Battle for Azeroth™.
This repository contains the source code of (most parts of) the website. It is built with [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) using [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [PHP](http://www.php.net/) and [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/). 

Currently the website has the following features:

* Full interactive Leaflet map of all Battle for Azeroth™ dungeons
* All known enemies and patrols inside dungeons are mapped and displayed on the map
* Enemy forces of all different NPCs in both normal and Teeming weeks are catalogued
* Route planning functions such as
  * Plotting a route through the dungeon, allowing a route to split up should the need arise
  * Selecting which enemies to kill
  * Optional free-form comments to indicate difficult enemies, strategies to use or abilities to use
* User voting so you can vote for your favorite route
* Favoriting of routes you liked best for easy reference
* Search function for looking up routes others have made
* When not registered, you are free to view any routes found in the search function, or when directly linked by others

## Not included in this repository
* Map tiles of all dungeons
* Software used for creating said map tiles (self-made)
